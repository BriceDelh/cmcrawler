cmcrawler.py

By Ian Lurie
Using the following amazing libraries, without which I'd be hopelessly out of luck:
urllib2
BeautifulSoup
urlparse

cmcrawler.py is meant to be a light, fast, Python-driven crawler.

To use the crawler, go to your command line (ACK, I KNOW!) and type 

python cmcrawler.py http://www.siteurl.com

It'll then cheerfully go off and start crawling your site, outputting the result as it goes. It doesn't save the output anywhere! You can cut-and-paste the result if you're really insane, or do the easier:

python cmcrawler.py http://www.siteurl.com >> filename.txt

That'll write the results to a text file, instead.

If none of this makes sense to you, you probably shouldn't be messing with this. I'm not saying that to be mean. This is a crawler written by someone who knows juuuuust enough to be dangerous. As such, you should be very, very careful with it.

I would greatly appreciate any improvements/tweaks that folks make. Please check them back into GIT or send 'em to me. This is a community thing, I hope.
